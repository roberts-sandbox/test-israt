	<h1>How I made this website?</h1>
	<p><a href="http://github.com/isarat/isarat.github.com/">This website is a github page.</a></p>
	
	<p>The theme is forked from an awesome guy called <a href="http://zachholman.com">Zach Holman</a>. He made this with awesome receipies like HTML5, SCSS, Coffee Scripts, webfonts etc. Don't blame me if this website doesn't appear well on Internet Explorer</p>
	
	<p> I really appreciate the excellent fonts produced by <a href="http://symbolset.com/">Symbolset</a> which shows the social network symbols found on this websites. Holman's original page repo contains the copy of the social fonts he purchased but I really loved it and I purchased my own from their website.</a>
	
	<p>This website is tracked by <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> and currently not ads are displayed in this website.
	
	<h1>Where I was all these years?</h1>
	<p> I have been blogging for years. Lot of technical tips I posted in my previous wordpress blog. Unfortunately I became so lazy to make better posts and was enjoying the traffic which was generated from my early popular posts. I decided to cannibalize the blog and start over something. The place I hosted my website was cheap but not so reliable. I wanted something simple, really hated FTPs, MySQLConsoles, backups and spammy plugings which has ruined my website once. Github is simple and plain. My posts are just few text files, I can take to anywhere. Also markup language of Github is awesome and not complications of HTML tags</p>
	
	<h1>What you will write here?</h1>
	<p>I am a techy guy. Just expect some geeky stuff here. I decided not to blog the obvious which doesn't really add value to my effort rather than generating some traffic.</p>
