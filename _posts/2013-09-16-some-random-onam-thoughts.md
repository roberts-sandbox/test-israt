Wherever you're in this world, for a Keralite Onam is a festival bring back memories, fun and takes you back to home. Even you can't reach home, it definitely carry you towards your loved ones.

## The beautiful old time
I had an amazing childhood for various reasons. I lived in a 100+ year old house (tharavad, in Malayalam) till my 12-13. I had good number of friends and relatives and I spent great time playing around with things which are in our culture, simple but yet powerful. We had no western influence. I had no TV at my home till I left that house. We all used to gather at any of our friend's house to watch the weekend movie in Dooradharshan on Sundays at 4.00 PM. All other time were playing, running through the big properties of my friends and neighbors. We played cricket, went for fishing, we fought for the monsoon flowers we collect during the Onam time to make pookkalam.

## I don't know my mother tounge
Kids watch TVs, cartoons  and never interested in going out and watch some cultural events outside. Kids watch translated Japanese cartoons, learn English and other languages. The new generation hardly knows to read English. 

This is not the case of everyone but these kind of westernization in our culture is killing the our great heritage and foundation. The parents are so busy to tell them what is our culture and pride.

The quality of our cultural celebrations are degrading. We can't give the simple but yet a beautiful experience of our parents given to our children.

## Change agents

When we open TV it's about controversies, scams, rapes, robbery etc. This country is struggling to find a hero. Nobody! The nation had so many heroes fought for our freedom. Now we are struggling and trying to get out of the dirty hands of politicians.

Every other change agent in this country is being celebrated like Anna Hazare, Rishi Raj Singh and lot many because 1 Billion+ people are looking forward for a change. The greatest power of this nation about the human resources and youth which is not used well. We are the people to get things done cheap for other developed countries. Yeah we are sold cheap but not a cheap standard for cheap people in India.

## Social Responsibilities = Facebook comments
The social responsibilities of people now shout at Facebook (including myself) against the crime and political issues. We are now suffering the problems of globalization in our country. We import more things than exporting our own products. The people in country don't give respect for the products produced in our motherland. They appreciate any imported products. 

There are lot of thoughts going through my head. Midst of all these I wish all of you a very happy Onam.
