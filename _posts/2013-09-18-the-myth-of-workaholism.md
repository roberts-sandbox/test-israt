Sitting at office and working late is considered to be a badge of honor in many companies. There are people who are obsessed over something and spend time is different from workaholism.

# Over planning
The problem I always found with people who sits late at office is they plan work after their regular office hours; just because they **can** sit late at office. 

# Excuse for being not efficient
We are in a dangerous situation if we get used with solving problems by simply extending working hours. We aren't putting any effort to improve the situation other than throwing hours at the problem. 

# Ignorance is a different business
You can't solve ignorance by sitting late at office. You have to **learn** things rather try to solve it using inelegant solutions. Inelegant solutions are always expensive and hard to maintain. 

When I was working with a client abroad I have seen a guy who reaches early morning and leave by 2 AM. I had to sit with a problem at that time for few days. I found this guy is even come for work in weekends and managers started praising his dedication, commitments etc.

Just by walking his side I have almost same code for consecutive days and I was signaled that he's stuck with something. Just out of curiosity and being a senior developer I asked him what he's up to. He genuinely explained his problem and I found it's pretty simple. I explained him the reason as the problem he was trying to sort out was one of the  pitfalls of C++. Sometimes you've to get out of the problem and talk to people. You can't just work hard and sit late to solve every other problems you bump in to.

# This isn't working in a long run
The coffee machines were running. I was up in the office at 2 AM. We were going to through a serious budget and resource problem and I was putting double effort to sort out this problem.

My customer came to my desk (yeah he was also stuck up with something) and asked why I am here still? I said the targets, efforts and available schedule. He replied "this is a problem which you shouldn't try to solve in your way. Rather we need to bring one more person here to solve the extra effort for integration testing. I know we have resource constraints, but let me have a word with my manager on this. Just realize the fact that this isn't going to work in long run."

He was right and that was the right way to sort out the problem! 

# Perfectionism
Sometimes we put more effort to perfect things before delivered. We need to focus what's need to be perfected and should be focused on the essential features. Above all there must be a cut off too about the degree of perfection

In other words, It's important to weigh what's worth extra effort and what's not. Working late isn't a measure to achieve more. The person who works hard and a person who works smart likely to achieve similar results over time as the smart person always solve his itch to efficiently solve the problem.
