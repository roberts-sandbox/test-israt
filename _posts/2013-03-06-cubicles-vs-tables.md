I was wondering on other day, why are we sitting in cubicles? It’s like I am totally isolated and doing my own work detached from rest of the people. It sounds a bit overrated but still we're sitting back to back. How much time we really speak each other? Yeah meeting rooms are the places we do ‘really’ collaborate or some hallways where we do quick standups. But on working together, why aren’t we seeing each other.

I am a huge fan of workspaces which helps people to collaborate. There are people who can write things single handedly and ship it but in most of the cases we are simply working as a 'team'. Hence there's hardly a chance for one man show. The people has to collaborate well each other to ship early and often. Whenever i bump into any of the articles talks about the workplaces, I carefully look at how the desks are organized?

On the other hand, I really love my own cubicle to keep my things there but apart from that, I wanted to be portable. I want to sit with people to solve problems quickly. The setup should help you function better for that.

But the most of the offices go by standard conventional cubicle setup to work. In the famous Valve employee handbook, it has mentioned.

> Why does your desk have wheels? Think of those wheels as a symbolic reminder that you should always be considering where you could move yourself to be more valuable. But also think of those wheels as literal wheels, because that’s what they are, and you’ll be able to actually move your desk with them. You’ll notice people moving frequently; often whole teams will move their desks to be closer to each other. There is no organizational structure keeping you from being in close proximity to the people who you’d help or be helped by most.

I have observed this several modern workplaces (yeah companies boast a lot about their workspaces on web), where people have open tables to collaborate well. This can’t be adapted always. It all depends on the degree of collaboration for the problem you’re solving. Sometimes it’s not possible at all especially when people collaborating from different geographical locations. In these type of cases, the virtual communication methods come in picture like Skype, Campfire, Asana etc.

Some of the examples are quora, github, facebook; all these have really modern work environment.  (sorry too lazy to give the credits. All the photos belongs to their respective owners and websites)

In the book, The Art of Agile Development it has mentioned about the importance to [sit together](http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/sit_together.html).

> In XP, the whole team—including experts in business, design, programming, and testing—sits together in a open workspace. When you have a question, you need only turn your head and ask. You get an instant response, and if something isn’t clear, you can discuss it at the whiteboard.

> Similarly, sit close enough to each other that you can have a quick discussion without getting up from your desk or shouting. This will also help encourage osmotic communication, which relies on team members overhearing conversations.

In the simplest form it appears like this ([taken from the story of sitting together](http://www.slideshare.net/zainabalikhan/the-story-of-sitting-together-final))

Agile way of working a hotcake in the industry. People wanted to ship products so often, especially web products. We really don’t need to think in terms of any agile way rather it’s important to have deep collaboration and communication between the people to solve the problems. Also teaming up together to solve problems is highly efficient than sitting isolated and work at a problem together makes huge impact on the thought process and time utilization.

So bring up the tables, leave your cubicles, get a white boards, look at each other and talk, solve the problems, [ship early and ship often.](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/ship-early-and-ship-twice-as-often/10150985860363920)
