People has love-hate relationship with Windows shell. For me the biggest frustration about the shell is about copy and delete. Hell with `Calculating...`. It really sucks!

There are enough articles about how to delete a Windows directory faster around the web. This is not really a hackers way, a lazy man's way to do things.

Suppose if you want to delete a large folder a `Shift+Delete` (sorry I am not really fond of recyle bins. It's designed for babies) the dialog pops up and started calculating the size and prepares the files to delete. Good, but how can I improve this?

 - Go ahead and presse `Alt+Enter` (Properties of the folder). Now Windows starts calculating the size of the folder and believe it or not, it's done pretty faster than the normal file delete dialog.
 - Now go ahead and `Shift+Delete` the same folder and enjoy skipping the `Calculating...` hell.

I don't know why it's this is implemented. May be you should ask [Raymond Chen](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/) for answers.
