Ohh boy, patent trolls are hell! Popularity and user-base are equally poisonous as patent trolls to stop innovating, if the one who holds is not committed to innovate. I am sure you’ve lot of examples on this. Let’s make it simple with a case study and infer the lessons. Let’s take the example of Google Reader.

[On launch, Google reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.in/2005/10/google-reader-two-weeks.html) killed every other RSS readers in the market, both paid and free. It was intuitive, fast and built on top of Google’s great infrastructure. Over the period of time Google did not improve any aspect of the Reader (for long); just like they did with Google Talk.

Definitely this has stopped other people on trying new products because overnight Google can crush you at any point of time with their great user base and popularity. It’s even simpler for tools like Google Reader.

Ever since [Google announced, wind up notice](http://googlereader.blogspot.in/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html) for the service (secretly in favor of Google+) I was searching for better alternatives.

Among all the alternatives and hacks, [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/) is a solid alternative I tried. Their most attractive features were it’s intuitive and [supported across various platforms](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/04/02/announcing-the-new-feedly-mobile-and-welcoming-3-million-reader-refugees/). Reader was never mobile friendly and costly (but minimally designed) apps like Reeder became very popular in no time(on iOS).  The team has ramped up well in no time to bring an excellent experience for users especially the ones jumping the ship from Reader.

[What we saw in the last couple of weeks with feedly is a beauty!](http://blog.feedly.com/) It’s a far better product than Google reader. Excellent sharing options (links, excerpts etc). Beautifully rendered pages, typography, shortcuts layout customizations and finally [facilitates all the possible ways to switch from Google Reader](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/tips-for-google-reader-users-migrating-to-feedly/) (without losing the essence of Feedly).

Until the shutdown news, hardly anybody heard/used Feedly now something went bad turns out to be good for all.

P.S: With this post, I never *intended* say Feedly or any other companies stopped innovation. They're brilliant and whenever required a solid product was ready to take up more users.
