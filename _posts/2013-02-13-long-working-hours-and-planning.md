It's a conventional belief that people who spends more time at work produces better results. It's a conventional thinking. This could be true to an extent if we consider typical factories where machines keep on working and humans are supervising them. Software is engineered, not manufactured. It's not mass produced by machines. For the creative processes long working hours and stretching won't work in the long run.

During the initial days of my career I stretched a lot to learn new stuffs and make things happen. It's quite common that people tends to throw sheer hours of effort for solving the problems and to meeting deadlines. Unless you're stretched work hours is an obvious cost effective solution.

In any business customer is the king. You will have to stretch a bit to meet your deadlines and save the business. Even it can please the superiors who has no clue on what you do and intricacies of it. If you're assessed based on the hours you're sitting in front of the computer, certainly you're working with wrong people.

I was up late night almost all the days few years back. Hell of stuffs were there to manage every day like coding, reviews, design, cordination, requirements capturing, integration testing. The list was pretty big. Even after leaving office close to midnight I continued to burn my ass at apartment.

Upon seeing me frequently late at office, my client came and told me. 

> "It's okay to stretch a day or two or maybe when you find it's so critical and unavoidable to stretch but if you consider this in the long run, this is not going to work. It's important to maintain work life balance. I used to leave at 2 AM from office and reaches here between 8-9 in the morning. I have been doing this for years and my new manager instructed me not to stretch beyond 10 PM. It's okay if you're sitting to learn something new but for the real work, the everyday-stretched hours indicate the problems in execution, planning or any other problems we need to solve. So think about it and see how better we can do this."

This has helped a lot and eventually I off-loaded some of the tasks after bringing up two more people to make things better. I started seeing sunsets again.

At times, we need time above everything else. Without time some problems are difficult to solve. In certain cases, it's equally important how we approach the problems. Lack of understanding on requirements, what we are working on, the technologies used can affect the project execution and individual performances. The right way to sort out such problems are sometimes seek expert advices by escalating without delay. You can spend your effort and time by simply sitting on a problem. If it's not solved after few hours, there's something wrong and it's important to bring this in to the notice of experts and stakeholders.

Sometimes it's hard to find people who can really help to solve the problem around. In that case, it requires external helps like programming communities, working groups etc. Usually the time to get a reply is exponentially higher than getting help from people around.

Coming back to the planning aspect of the story. [The famous employee handbook of Valve talks about this](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf)

> the most part working overtime for extended periods indicates a fundamental failure in planning or communication. If this happens at Valve, it's a sign that something needs to be reevaluated and corrected. If you're looking around wondering why people aren't in "crunch mode," the answer's pretty simple. The thing we work hardest at is hiring good people, so we want them to stick around and have a good balance between work and family and the rest of the important stuff in life.

A proper plan is your compass to right direction and align you effort towards what we need to accomplish. In any of the above situations, it leads to plans and planning. The plan might have screwed due to unforeseen incidents, lack of proper planning, lack of understanding about the requirements, changed priorities, your time got eaten up by unplanned tasks. Plan is a living document. It's not one time task, it has to be replanned, reiterated, made it crystal clear on the go.  

Stretched working hours definitely affects the creativity and productivity of the people and later affects the project as a whole. A good manager (or individual) has to sense this bullshit and come forward to solve this well.
