I am a huge markup fan. It was one of the primary reasons behind moving to Jekyll powered GitHub (blog) pages. I explained about this on [recepie](http://sarat.in/recepie) in this page.

Why markup. When I first saw markup based Question and answer boxes on Stackoverflow, I found it like why these guys are so much into a weird syntax. Almost all forums or Q&A website offers an HTML based box for formatting the text. 

I was religiously blogging with Wordpress all these years. I went for the free options first with wordpress.com and I did not like Wordpress making money with my blogs. Also I had an intention to learn web programming with a self hosted website. Wordpress (.com) gives zero control on the installed template. Custom CSS and all the needy features are paid option with wordpress.com. 

Considering the amount I pay and the size of the blog. Setting up the blog was incredibly fast but later, I was pissed off with the shared hosting and frequent crashes, spam attacks on posts etc. I had to stop blogging later. I stopped blogging for almost an year and later it was reduced to once a while post. The visitor count of my blog came down from thousands to hundreds. I was spending time on managing the MySQL database back ups. And the filthy support from the hosting service did not help me much to resolve the problems.

The biggest pain was about writing something and posting it. Earlier version of Wordpress has poor editor, managing the media contents especially image insertion was a pain in the ass. It was improve a lot later but the web based editor of wordpress is an underdog. I was always skeptical about losing my writing though it has an save draft option. Windows Live Writer was a solid writer but often I faced some HTML code generation issue like code formatting etc. The Wordpress blog writing experience has been considerably improved  of late but the infrastructure woes bothered me a lot.

Another point is about formatting code. With wordpress there are lot code formatting plugins are available. With some plugins it’s easy to express without <pre> or <code> tag. Just enclose the code within the preffered keyword they mention. Once we move out of the plugin, the code format will be a different story.

Learning Jekyll and markup languages was awesome. I saw markup language before with Wikipedia but it’s crippled. Markup originally invented by one of my favorite blogger [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

>> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

Markup has been religiously used in stack exchange websites and Github, two of my most favorite programming resource. Github is the company I admire a lot. They’re simply awesome with what they do. With Jekyll framework, they were solving their own problem. Also supports most modern HTML technologies like Coffee Script, SCSS etc. All your resources are simply few text files formatted with markup syntax. btw, Github has it’s own markup but it follows the original markup language.

Jeff Atwood (who writes [codinghorror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/)) had an interesting post about markup language. He urged several people form a standard way to use markup langauges and improve the state of it. 

In my opinion, whatever we present to the user like web pages, UI etc Must be expressed with markup languages. One of the most interesting aspect of the WPF is about the expressibility of how the visual appearance of the UI can be easily expressed with few HTML like tags, but it’s better than HTML.

Blog posts uses only less amount HTML. Mostly text and image embedding commands. The foundation uses the necessary HTML functionality and the content must be really free of the complexity of HTML. Markup intercept perfectly to focus on content and ask to focus less on the HTML tags.

Now writing something on blog is simple as writing a text file. I use Google Docs to write my blogs and copy paste to a editor like Notepad++ and format it later. (Seriously thinking of a plugin which can ease up my job). I am pretty fine with any text editor; using Google Docs is simply for spell check.

Finally if you want to generate this as any format, it’s easy to write simple programs to parse it. The conversion across platforms are hell lot of simple.
