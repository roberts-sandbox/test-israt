One year back, on October world embraced the news with a shock! Steve Jobs passed away. Just on the previous day we all watched iPhone 4S launch. People were not satisfied with Tim Cook because people around the world saw Steve Jobs as the face of the company. The charismatic keynotes always been the best celebrated events in the tech industry. 

People were unable to think about Apple without Steve. He's famous for keeping his secrets but he wasn't really secretive about this illness. He always passed the right information to the world.

I did not know it was already 5th October. I was a bit low due to some issues at office. I wanted some inspiration and as I have doing it for years, just fired the Stanford keynote sharp at 12:03 AM IST. It could be a coincidence that I wanted watch that video but I was so happy that I did that knowingly on unknowingly.

I was preparing for exams at that time for the part time degree course I was joined. I stopped studying and cried like a baby at my home. Nobody was there! I did not know why I cried for a person whom I never met, not really closely attached but he was truly my inspiration and the one and only one personal heroes. It's irreplaceable. I don't think this will be changed ever till my death.

I never knew about Steve Jobs. The Apple products were never been affordable for a typcial Indian. I waited for years to buy an iPhone, truly! I bought it after 4 years ever since it was introduced. I never went behind the brand name or anything. I experienced the quality of their products. I was equally inquisitive about the flexibility of their products.

Seriously I became as a kind of advanced user than being a hacker to try too many stuffs with iPhone and iPad. I realized why people loved Steve and his products. They were super simple easy to use and fucking hot to hold it in your hand.

The bugs of Apple products celebrated like anything by competitors, just realize that you're pointing out one or two. Apple has a habit of delivering what they promise. On the other hand, Android and other platforms are still trying to catch up with the quality of iOS platform.

Some of the best things I would remember is that, iPod, iPhone then the Mountain Lion operating system. They've taken all their learning back to their desktop.

iPhone still claims to be the best phone in the world, iPad yet to find any serious competition, MacBook Airs and MacBook pros are being ballatantly copied by the copy cats and still thrive with their sales.
On reading his biography I was getting more close to Steve. The dedication, the innovativeness, creativity nobody can ever think of coming from a CEO's point of view. The sheer guts to get what he wanted. The best example would be the iPhone name. Nobody still knows how the deals were made. Steve never signed in any deals with CISCO before taking iPhone to the stage. It might have been an expensive deal but doesn't matter. He has got his own ways to get things done. Mostly unconventional.

I read one another book called "Insanely Simple: The Obsession That Drives Apple's Success" by Ken Segall. Though it appeared like fanboi written book, the stories on working with Steve was awesome.

I can't tell what all Steve did was right or not, but he suceeded with what all he did. Steve was never would be able to take failures. I could not find any single moment he failed in the last decade at least.

I would like to quote few single liners before clossing this post

Steve nobody asked in front of the whole employees to "Fuck off Micheal dell" when Mr.Dell asked Apple to sell the assets and give shareholder's monye back.

Nobody reformed the entire team when Steve realized that MobileMe group could not deliver what they're supposed to deliver.

Nobody never threw a nearly completed product at the team working on it. He said he can't sell the product because keeping keys together could scratch the screen. And Corning CEO was never would have convinced himself in his organization's ability to deliver on demand without Job's  reality distortion field. The result was world's best phone till date when it was launched. Later Corning became an integral part of the mobile hardware industry.

The sheer guts to take the name iPhone without any settlements! I can't say it was legally right or not. A pirate never would think in hypocrite's way to get things done. He just did what he felt right and he had all the money and influence support his action and always did it.

And as you said, the phones are still 5 years younger than iPhone in terms of perfection and usability.

You're insanely great, irreplaceable and a legend. You will always live in our hearts. I hope the whole heaven started using iPhone or some new kind of device which Tim Cook never thought about. Love you Steve.
