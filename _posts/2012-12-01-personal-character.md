Undoubtedly Code Complete (2) is the best book I ever read in my life about Software Engineering. It's truly a handbook for every software out there. The book is full of gems and stands against time on talking about the timeless concepts of Software Engineering. 
In the book,  the very specific chapter "Personal Character"  is an  excellent piece of writing on Software Engineering. which nobody learns at school.

I am scribbling down some of the interesting points I found in the chapter. Have a look!

- Your employer can't force you to become a good programmer. If you want to be great, you're responsible for making yourself great.

- The people who are best at programming are the people who realize how small their brains are. The more you learn to compensate for your small brain, the better programmer you will be. The more humble you're the faster you'll improve.

- If you're not curious enough to keep up with the changes, you may find yourself down at the old-programmer's home!

- Keep on reading. Read documentation about your product, other books and periodical. If you read even one good programming book  every two months,  roughly 35 pages a week, you'll soon have a grasp on the industry and distinguish yourself from nearly everyone around you!

- Don't pretend yourself as an expert when you're not. Readily admit your mistakes

- Be realistic about status reports, schedules and estimates

- If she refuses to admit her mistake. the only person  she'll fool is herself.

- Truly excellent programmers learn how to work and play well with others. Writing readable code is part of being team player.

- The small tasks are never bad as they seem. If you develop the habit of doing them right away, you can avoid the procrastinating kind of laziness.

- If you work for 10 years, do you get 10 years of experience or do you get 1 year of experience 10 times? You have to reflect on your activities to get true experience. If you make learning a continuous commitment, you'll get experience. If you don't, you won't, no matter how many years you have under your belt.
