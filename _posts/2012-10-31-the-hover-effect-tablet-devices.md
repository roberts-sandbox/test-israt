I posted a question on Quora some time back about simulating the hover effects in a touch device. I had this question when a  desktop website was accessed on iPad, where I was trying to select a link which is hidden as a sub-menu. It pops up when hover the mouse on this item.

[Should we simulate hovering effect on touch based devices?](http://www.quora.com/Should-we-simulate-hovering-effect-on-touch-based-devices)

The fact is that the knowledge sharing website hardly helps to you solve the problem. It talks about the history, provides you links etc. but hardly get any strong research information or else it must be hidden as secret innovation.

For the first time ever I loved Samsung for this. With Galaxy Note 2, they've nailed out two problems. First is about the innovations they made with S-Pen device and second is about pitching the product to the right audience.

##AirView - an extended human interaction with touch devices

The history says we need 'some accessories' or so called machines to achieve things faster. Adding up something with human abilities always helps us to achieve things faster. But for some purpose our bare hands are good enough. For e.g it's so weird to pull out the stylus to touch the UI elements on the screen. It's equally weird if you're using your bare hands with a touch device to draw something as a thick pointing finger can hide at least 25% of a 3.6" inch screen.

With the first version of Galaxy Note, the s-pen was kind of another smart version of an old stylus. The device wasn't really attractive and the software in it simply sucked. The product wasn't really pitched right to the users but yeah it sold well I guess.

The AirView feature with S-pen is an amazing innovation or an innovation integrated for the first time with a commercial device to improve the experience. This opens a wide possibility for apps to explore AirView  and provide fresh extended UX to the users. And hovering is one of the problem which AirView can solve. Let's wait for people come up with smart ideas for their app with AirView. This video demonstrate the built-in apps which enabled AirView experiences - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGpDHo-Zzf8

##Pitching product to the right community
A phablet device is not well suited for phone calls. Pitching it as just another phone is terrible. Also the first version of Galaxy Note sucked at pitching it well.

With Galaxy Note 2, Samsung roped in the celebrities like Imtiaz Ali to talk about the Galaxy Note and how it helps a creative mind. Especially with S-Pen

The innovation and improvements made the S-Pen a really makes Note II a desiring device for the creative minds. With iPad, the accessories are too costly and most of them falls to into mediocre quality. To be frank I really wished if there's a S-Pen like device for my iPad to use with Paper.

Share your thoughts with me on Galaxy Note 2 and how it really helps. Put aside your fanboy caps be frank just like an Apple Fanboy writing about Samsung here.

Note: I might talk negative about Samsung in the next post. Hope you don't mind!
