This is one of my favorite quote ever since I found. I am hard core C++ programmer thoughout my career. People admits my expertise in C++ and Windows Platform knowledge. I started everything with C, then C++, then Visual C++ etc. My knowledge was sufficient enough to carry out most of my assignments. 

>> I hated C# to the core; I had tough time gulping WPF, Still curious about WCF; I really wanted to know REST works, XMPP works, how to design a compelling HTML5 website.

True, I am not expert is none of the above, the primary domain I work is Healthcare domain and I believe even it's a single line of code, I keep the radiologists happy, patient safe; there are so many things to br pride about. But in the technical front lot of technolgies like Cloud, new useful frameworks etc. helps to solve the problems better. Once I took interview with famous Spotify and they said, most of their employees are either on Mac or Linux dev boxes. Hardly you can find any Windows programmers. I was curious! I was clarified later that, open source technologies and frameworks truly helps to focus on problem than reinventing wheels.

I hated C# initially just because it consumes lot of memory and the hardware then wasn't really capable of running a C# programs, it's at least 5 times slower than C++, hardly you've control on the memory. I simply love C++ and similar close-to-hardware language. To write a custom button with Windows (MFC) you will have to define a new class derived from CButton (with MFC) and I should extend how it should appears on the screen. It helped me a lot on learing the indepth details of GDI, Messaging and other core fundamentals of the framework and platform. I mean the whole low level experience was nothing but charming and helped to program better.

>> IMHO In today's world, being a single language fanboy will not work anymore. Most problems today are better served by embracing Polyglot programming and using the right tool for the job. Neal Ford has a pretty good talk on this subject if you ever have a chance to catch it at a No Fluff Just Stuff.

But all these years I programmed in this langauge. Software becomes complex everywhere, implementing something down from the top is actually a pain in the ass. It can't always real-world problems quickly. The new trend is about adopting agile methods to deliver fast. Week by week companies deliver new stuffs. The conventional way of programming wasn't really like that.

On fast iterations, it's important to focus on problems than spending time on basic infrastructure. Once you get over with most of the pitfalls, tricks, and in depth knowledge on language or frameworks, things will more or less like a routine job. Arguably conventional languages and frameworks aren't really sufficieent to solve of the current age.

The frameworks with Ruby, Python etc. are really useful, reliable and quick to develop. I have tried to solve a graph problem with C++, C# and Python. Though I am ameatur Python programmer, I found it's easy to develop C++ Python rather than working with C++. If your class consists of pointers you have to be careful and has to write several operator overloading like Copy Constructors, operator= etc. This becomes increasingly painful if the size of the program is big enough. Like that several instance.

One of the other example would be, while displaying several records to user, it's easy to diplay with proven controls or a web page itself displayed in the application. There are several frameworks to embed Google Chrome, Firefox and by default support for IE. I can take less pain in writing beautiful UI and I can leverage the advantage of CSS, HTML and excellent memory management techniques implemented by browsers. I really don't need to be worreied lot of things like memory management etc.

Now I am learnign Ruby, Python and other new web technologies like Django, Rails etc. to make myself competent enough in the industry and finally to satisfy my thirst to learn. In my opinion, a programmer should learn at least 3 languages to make their life and they've to carefully which one would help them to solve their problems well. Like C++ give you total control on what you do, but it has so many pitfalls, the beautiful language expressions and readability of C# is awesome and run on proven .NET framework. Python's simplicity and ability to manage data helps you to explore data well and can make use of so many frameworks for your need like Django etc. Ruby and Rails is the most prominent language and web technologies. It's growing fast and hepls to make web programming better. Learn these to solve problems quickly but never miss the foundations and fundamentals of computer science.
