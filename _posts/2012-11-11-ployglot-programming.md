This is became one of my favorite quote ever since I found. I am hard core C++ programmer thoughout my career. People admits my expertise in C++ and Windows Platform knowledge. I started everything with C, then C++, then Visual C++ etc. My knowledge was sufficient enough to carry out most of my assignments. 

I hated C# to the core; I had tough time gulping WPF, Still curious about WCF; I really wanted to know REST works, XMPP works, how to design a compelling HTML5 website.

True, I am not expert is none of the above, the primary domain I work is Healthcare domain and I believe even it's a single line of code, I keep the radiologists happy, patient safe; there are so many things to br pride about. But in the technical front lot of technolgies like Cloud, new useful frameworks etc. helps to solve the problems better. Once I took interview with famous Spotify and they said, most of their employees are either on Mac or Linux dev boxes. Hardly you can find any Windows programmers. I was curious! I was clarified later that, open source technologies and frameworks truly helps to focus on problem than reinventing wheels.

I hated C# initially just because it consumes lot of memory and the hardware then wasn't really capable of running a C# programs, it's at least 5 times slower than C++, hardly you've control on the memory. I simply love C++ and similar close-to-hardware language. To write a custom button with Windows (MFC) you will have to define a new class derived from CButton (with MFC) and I should extend how it should appears on the screen. It helped me a lot on learing the indepth details of GDI, Messaging and other core fundamentals of the framework and platform. I mean the whole low level experience was nothing but charming and helped to program better.

>> IMHO In today's world, being a single language fanboy will not work anymore. Most problems today are better served by embracing Polyglot programming and using the right tool for the job. Neal Ford has a pretty good talk on this subject if you ever have a chance to catch it at a No Fluff Just Stuff.

As my responsibilities grown up it's really a tough time concenrating on solving problems and I spend lot of time spoonfeeding compilers. The core languages like C++, is considered to use when you really want neck to neck performance in some situations. If it's large product, people solves problem with multiple tools. like high performance backend activities with C++, WPF/C# Forms for UI, WCF for communication etc. Java Script and HTML for web interfaces.

<div class="aside">
  <p>Our job is to solve problems, not spoonfeed compilers, so we like dynamic languages that adapt to us, without arbitrary, rigid rules. We need clarity so we can communicate using our code. We value conciseness and the ability to express a requirement in code accurately and efficiently. The less code we write, the less that can go wrong. (And our wrists and fingers are thankful, too.)

One of the other example would be, while displaying several records to user, it's easy to diplay with proven controls or a web page itself displayed in the application. There are several frameworks to embed Google Chrome, Firefox and by default support for IE. I can take less pain in writing beautiful UI and I can leverage the advantage of CSS, HTML and excellent memory management techniques implemented by browsers. I really don't need to be worreied lot of things like memory management etc.

Interpretted languages can make your life so easy. It's equally important to get expertise in general-purpose compiled programming languages like C, C++ etc. Java and C# sitting in the middle of compiled and interpreted programming languages. These languages also offer some kind of dynamic behavior like interpreted languages.

IMO, a programmer should get expertise in at least 3 programming languages like C, C++ second is C# or Java and interpreted languages like Python Ruby and as the landscape of the web is changing, it also good to get hands on with latest web technologies like HTML5, JavaScript etc.

Projects like Swig helps you to make bindings between different programming languages to make use of the excellent features of each languages. But we can't tell whether this helper frameworks will really help you to solve your problem as several limitations are there while talking in different 'languages'.
