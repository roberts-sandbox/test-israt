Nine years back, when I started my career, the shape of tech world was quite different. We've seen several new things success, failures, the startup revolution, mobile revolution, cloud revolution. So many are there to count.

Arguably huge portion of the tech revolution was mostly connected to Apple, Google and Facebook. Let me start with this quote from the famous Think Different campaign.

> Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

Let me recall some of the revolutions I observed in the last decade.
##Internet Search
Google is far ahead than anybody else in the game. Not really needs and introduction to Google!
##E-Mail
At that time, I remember I had 2MB of capacity in my Hotmail acount and was later changed to 25MB. Yahoo! had 100MB of storage later. Google had struck all the email providers with two most important things Simplicity and Storage. 1GB of storage was almost a dream at that time. Everyone had their own local copy  of emails. Now I can't think of backing up my Gmail to any local drives. It's there in GBs. It was a fresh bar raised by Google and Email never been the same again.
##Java on Phones
No to Java, when iPhone was introduced Java was ruling the phones and the apps were plenty (most of them were cheap ones). There's nothing called a paid quality mobile applications. Even mobile Internet was really a baby Internet at that time.
##HTML5
Steve Jobs explained why he's not [allowing] flash in iOS (iPhone OS then) platform? It's buggy non-standard. Apple enforced the effort to push mobile Safari is the way out there. The HTML bandwagon was followed by all the popular browsers now the world really doesn't need flash or Microsoft's ActiveX controls to make rich Internet contents. They winners some 10 years back where the browsers were baby browsers, the shape of Internet was something different.

##Browser War
Internet explorer still the most popular browser in the world but it has bias towards Microsoft's old non-standard routes. It doesn't obey the standard. Performance isn't not par to render complex and visually rich contents.

Firefox was launched with the intention to provide better browser experience. I am purposefully forgetting Opera, which walked all these path long time before but at wrong time and miserably failed. Tabbed browsing, highly useful extensions which can transform your experience and productivities to the next level.

We thought Firefox is perfect to the world. We've see a major disruption with a speedy, safer and minimal browser called "Google Chrome". Within short time, Chrome is close to Internet Explorer and soon gonna take over with the crown of "World's popular browser".
##iPhone
Ask me why I say iPhone as the most revolutionary product ever introduced by Apple.

Both hardware and software introduced with iPhone was revolutionary. None of the phones then had the hardware features came along with iPhone like touch screen, no-hardware-keyboard, GPS, scratch proof glass, excellent platform which doesn't have the heaviness of Java. As Steve Jobs said "This phone is at least 5 years ahead of the existing smartphones" that's true. The first versions of Android phone software was more like a Java enabled phone. If Apple never set that standard for smartphones, smartphones never would have been the same.

It's important to set these bars high by the right people at right time. Fortunately it had happened in tech industry all the time. The companies especially on getting bigger and bigger become more hypocractic and enjoy to live in their comfort zone without pushing themselves to the next level.

As Steve Jobs mentioned once "We're world's biggest startup". The passion to solve the problems and to give more to the world is timeless. The startup revolution has changed things a lot in the space.

Now we are enjoying the next generation of experience. Cloud, mobile, tablets, rich Internet services, excellent user experience. Behind all these there are people who tirelessly trying to improve the world a better place. Let's support contribute and in one fine day let us all be revolutionists, eccentrics and the crazy one to change the world by setting new bar for future!
