I happened to read recently in some magazine that, Sufi-sm is about breaking the our comfort zone. I am not into religions but it's an interesting concept. Everyone lives in their comfort zone.

Leaving the comfort zone is difficult especially once you become successful with your effort.  Steve Jobs said in his epic Stanford Commencement speech,

> The heaviness of being successful was replaced with the lightness of being beginner again.

Nobody really want their hands dirty. Why would need to hurt your comfort zone? If we observe carefully, the people who made their dirty consistently was almost right and rewarded later in their life.
##Getting your hands dirty

There are several people in front of you Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Google Founders, Jeff Bezos, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk the lists are endless!

Steve Jobs is the most celebrated CEO in the world. Why people loves him? Getting impressed with Steve Notes? No way! A person can't lie for long time even people say Steve Lie or the reality distortion field can drive you crazy! No!! a big no! he loved what he did. That he said several times. It's true that, "no one can in this world can make iPhone". On reading the stories, we can understand how much effort went behind to make things perfect at Apple. Steve got his hand dirty to save his company from bankruptcy. He knew that it's hard to tackle the PC market  which is hugely dominated by Microsoft. Rather selling hardware, he learned to consistently generate money by producing content (music for iPod) and make it easy to purchase. iTunes was a revolution for music industry. Later, he made MacBooks and iMacs to so compelling to by pulling people to beautifully designed Apple Store! Nobody attempted this before! He hand was really dirty when he attempted this later washed off everything and smiled at the world!

When Facebook was founded, Mark Zuckerberg would never thought of one fine day in October, 2012 his venture counts a billionth user! What he solved was the dilemma of social networks. What Facebook now is evolved through years!

When [Jack Dorsey, sketched a simple idea in his notebook](http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/jackdorsey/182613360/sizes/l/) Twitter was born. Which is the most happening place in real-time. Twitter successfully brought the concept of real-time to the web. There were early attempts but Twitter made it so lucrative that everyone including facebook and Google wished if they could have the real-time engine like twitter.

Elon Musk walks a different path. When he was done with the Internet entrepreneurship he wanted to think about improving the sad state of auto industry! Tesla Motors was born there. Later he thought outside earth and SpaceX was founded.

Google founders decided to take "snapshot" of the web which was relatively small and early stage of Internet adoption was about. 

Jeff Bezoz never wanted to sell products in a conventional way. Amazon, the online store redefined several dimensions of online-retail.

##Scratching Own Itch

Most of the people know there are problems exists. But not really wanted to get our hands dirty. Everyone who thinks about starting something their own always bumped into this common problem. "Ohh shit! I had that idea!". Truth to be told, the person never wanted his hands dirty! But who dug the mud made it possible!

The world is lazy and seeks out for solution rather solving problems themselves.

Github is an awesome company which foster innovation. I must say 'social coding' is a game changer.  github added a new dimension for coding. They made their hand dirty by taking up the version control which was originally written by Linus Torvalds and taken it to the next level. They never stopped by limiting themselves as a place where you can host the code. Rather they solved their own problems. The state of art Jekyll Framework which powers GitHub Pages. The github pages are beautifully rendered and even you can create your own static blog under github! They found another problem; the presentations are shared and consumed so poorly and they found a beautiful solution with SpeakerDeck. They had a simple concept in mind. In his post [link] John Hoyt mentioned, [history of speakerdeck](http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/03/the-history-of-speaker-deck/)

>Speaker Deck was born in a little Irish bar right around the corner from our offices in South Bend Indiana in May of 2010. I was meeting Steve and John for lunch and they were talking about how much they disliked the slide sharing options currently available. It was of special interest to them as they do a lot of public speaking and at the time were teaching classes at Notre Dame.

You can see lot of examples in and around! Do what you love to do. Facebook never cared about Orkut, Apple ignored the existing MP3 players in the world, Github ignored the mature code hosting websites. Like a real farmer get yourself dirty and happily harvest later!
