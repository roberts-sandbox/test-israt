[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is the heroic text editor for Windows. On the other hand there's another beauty for the Mac users called [Textmate](http://macromates.com/). Textmate has better collection of themes than notepad++. 

I am huge fan of whatever-done-by-github. [Github has it's own textmate theme](https://github.com/blog/73-github-textmate-theme) which is really refreshing. Yeah I want it to my Notepad++. 

I did not want to take all effort of duplicating the colors and other elements in the Notepad++ format. [tmTheme2nppStyler](http://framework.lojcomm.com.br/tmTheme2nppStyler/) is a handy utility which helps you converting textmate themes to Notepad++ theme.

You can find the github theme for textmate [here](https://github.com/sbecker/github_textmate_theme) or you can use any of your favorite themes listed [here](http://wiki.macromates.com/Themes/UserSubmittedThemes)

It's very simple. Copy the whole xml, paste it to [tmTheme2nppStyler](http://framework.lojcomm.com.br/tmTheme2nppStyler/). Download it, Save to `<your_notepad++_installation folder>\themes`. Restart `Notepad++`.

Initially the font name will be empty. You can set your favorite fonts in the global styles with the `Settings > Style Configurarator...` option. Also on the right bottom side you can apply the global font styles for all the syntaxes.
