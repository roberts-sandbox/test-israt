I love the goodness of plain text. I can draft things without clutters of blog editor. I can use my favorite [iA Writer on iPad](http://www.iawriter.com/) or [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to make a post to my github blog.

It's easy to test the site changes with the help of Jekyll. Running 'jekyll --server' helps easy to tests the posts (it creates the local host [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000))

[Markpad](http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/) helps us great in this context. It's an [open source project hosted on github](https://github.com/Code52/DownmarkerWPF). The tool features an awesome Metro UI (Windows 8 style) and helps to easily integrate with Github repository. The integrated edit and publish makes easy. (I personally prefers to publish using the commandline/using Github for Windows)

Some of the major features 

 - Side-by-side Preview - Markdown is easy to grok, but how do you know its going to turn out perfect? A side-by-side preview, rendered in real time, thats how!
 - Single exe, portable
Portable, right out of the box. Everything is in a single executable.
 - Spellchecker - Markdown can be done in any text editor, but why must the experience degrade to Notepad? No more. MarkPad has spellchecker and a floating syntax tool bar

Have a great blogging time!
